example of the while loop

SEMANTICS
1. We first capture the value of the variable ie i;
2. We use the while keyword to initialize the while loop
3. The program will continue to print the code to be executed as long as the condition in the while loop is still valid or true.
4. It will continue to iterate through different values of i until the condition is met.
