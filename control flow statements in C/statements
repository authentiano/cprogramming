If staments help the program to make decision based on the conditions provided
it executes one block if the condition is true and another if the condition is false.

# the Nested if
The nested if helps to chech multiple conditions in hierarchical manner, the inner if is only evaluated when the outer if is true

if(condition1){
     // Execute code when the condition1 is true.
    if(condition2){
        //execute code when condition2 is true and one is true.
    }else{
        //code when condition 2 is false and condition1 is true
    }
}else{
    code to execute when condition1 is false
}

# Switch statements.
These are preferably used when you are comparing a variable against multiple values
These are preferably better because the reduce on the complexity and amibiquity that can 

# Difference between if-else, nested if and the switch statements.

if-else
1. used to execute singular conditions. 
2. simple and straightforward.
3. evaluated condtions and logical comparisons. 

Nested if
1. adds addition layer for decision making
2. executes in hierarchical manner.
3. can become complex when the if become so many

switch
1. compares one expression against multiple constant values.
2. Designed for calculating and evaluating discrete cases.
