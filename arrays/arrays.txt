# arrays are used to store multiple values in a single
variable, instead of declaring separate variable for each values

to create an array, define the data type like the int, and specify the name
we they are comma separated values, or collections. 
They are inside curly braces and make sure the values are of the same data type

These are are a collection of elements with the same datatype; grouped 
eg 
    int myNumbers[] = { 25, 50, 56, 59};

    We use the index number to access the elements in the list
    and the index start from 0 [0], this is the element 1
